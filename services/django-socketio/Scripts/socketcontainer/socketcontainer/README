For the socket messages:

user_prompt: Expects several pieces of data in the body: userId, params(tbd if needed or replaced), 
jiraToken, userPrompt

User id is the standard ID pulled from the database - this means the client must pull from the
REST API database and send it back. 

Params are general values meant to be sent to either the Jira API or the promptAPI - it is very much a placeholder.

jiraToken is the authentication token for usage with Jira services.

userMessages is what the user entered as a search value or question - this is appended onto all previous messages for a room.

The response will be finished_prompt_msg.

finished_prompt_msg: This message is a full response of what the AI API responded with and prompt were.
Any Jira data that we grabbed is also sent back.

error_msg: A simple response that consists of one dictionary that contains an error message and echoed back to the userID that sent a request.

handle_connect: Expects one piece of data in the body: userId

responds with entered_room which is a simple confirmation of the user being assigned to a room.
